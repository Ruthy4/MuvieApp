# MuvieApp

A simple android app written in Kotlin that applies the clean architecture concept. It uses Kotlin Gradle DSL which brings Kotlinâ€™s rich language features to Gradle configuration. The project also uses ktlint using spotless to enforce proper code style. Github actions handle continuous integration and run ktlint, lint and unit tests concurrently.

# Building source

In the `local.properties` file in your project-level directory, add the following code to the file. Replace `API_KEY` with your API key
